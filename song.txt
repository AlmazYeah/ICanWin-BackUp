Hee-heh-he-hah
I come from the land of the Irish spring
Dublin's the place where I learned my thing
From the emerald isle to your place in the hood
I'm a man of green comes to do no good
Lep in the hood comes to do no good

I'm a weird green guy who's new to town
Show me what you do when you get down

The end!
